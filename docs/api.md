# API Reference

!!! warning "Library usage not recommended"
    I recommend using TACT mainly via its [console commands](commands.md) for stability and best results. To get started, see the [Tutorial](tutorial.md).


While TACT can be used as a Python library, its internal interface is subject to change at any time, even for minor or patch versions. This API documentation is provided merely for the sake of completeness.
